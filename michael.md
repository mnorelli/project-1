# Project Feedback + Evaluation for Michael Norelli


## Categories:

**Project Workflow:**
Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program you’re in (detailed above)?

**Technical Requirements:**
Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

**Creativity:**
Did you added a personal spin or creative element into your project submission? Did you deliver something of value to the end user (not just a login button and an index page)?

**Code Quality:**
Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors have in class?

**Deployment:**
Did you deploy your application to a public url using GitHub Pages?

**Total:**
Your instructors will give you a total score on your project.

## Rubric:

Score | Expectations
----- | ------------
**0** | _Incomplete._
**1** | _Does not meet expectations._
**2** | _Meets expectations, good job!_
**3** | _Exceeds expectations, you wonderful creature, you!_

## Your Scores:

| Workflow                |   |
|-------------------------|---|
| Project Workflow:       | 3 |
| Technical Requirements: | 2 |
| Creativity:             | 3 |
| Code Quality:           | 2 |
| Deployment              | 2 |
| Total                   | 12|

## Notes:

Excellent job on project planning and workflow. Beautiful commit history (though present tense would be preferable, you clearly commited often and thoughtfully)

Technical Requirement Checklist:
Render a game in the browser [√]

Design logic for winning & visually display which player won [ ]

Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files [√]

Stick with KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles [√]

Use Javascript or jQuery for DOM manipulation [√]

Deploy your game online, where the rest of the world can access it [√]

Use semantic markup for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices) [√]

6/7 on explicate Technical Requirements. Was it reasonably complex? You were attempting something MORE than reasonably complex and came up short. I feel that this is fine, and you will take what you have learned about scope and time management to your work ahead.

Creativity-wise, you made this project yours. Great job.

Your code quality is up to snuff for this point in the program. Watch out for indentation and start thinking about how you might refactor your larger functions into smaller ones, like your showMap function for example.
